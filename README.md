# **German License Plate Recognition**

## Project Introduction

This project is to create a small Android app that allows to recognize the license plate of a car quickly and easily with the camera of a smartphone or tablet and translate the license into plain text. 
The app marks the recognized license plate within the camera image with a bounding box and displays the determined license in plain text as annotation above or below the bounding box, as can be seen in the following example:
