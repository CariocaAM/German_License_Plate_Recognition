# **German License Plate Recognition**

## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a small Android app that allows to recognize the license plate of a car quickly and easily with the camera of a smartphone or tablet and translate the license into plain text. The app should mark the recognized license plate within the camera image with a bounding box and display the determined license in plain text as annotation above or below the bounding box, as outlined in the following screen mockup:
